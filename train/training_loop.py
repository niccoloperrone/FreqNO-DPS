  """Runs trainer for a training task.

  This function runs a trainer in batches of "metric aggregation" steps, where
  the step-wise metrics obtained within the same batch are aggregated
  (i.e. by computing the average and/or std based on the metric defined in
  the trainer class). The aggregated metrics are then automatically saved to a
  tensorflow event file in workdir. Evaluation runs periodically, i.e. once
  every eval_every_steps steps, if an eval dataloader is provided.

  Args:
    train_dataloader: A dataloader emitting training data in batches.
    trainer: A trainer object hosting the train and eval logic.
    workdir: The working directory where results (e.g. train & eval metrics) and
      progress (e.g. checkpoints) are saved.
    total_train_steps: Total number of training steps to run.
    metric_aggregation_steps: The trainer runs this number of steps at a time,
      after which training metrics are aggregated and logged.
    eval_dataloader: An evaluation dataloader (optional). If set to None, no
      evaluation will run.
    eval_every_steps: The period, in number of train steps, at which evaluation
      runs. Must be an integer multiple of metric_aggregation_steps.
    num_batches_per_eval: The number of batches to step through every time
      evaluation is run (resulting metrics are aggregated).
    run_sanity_eval_batch: Whether to step through sanity check eval batch
      before training starts. This helps expose runtime issues early, without
      having to wait until evaluation is first triggered (i.e. after
      eval_every_steps).
    metric_writer: A metric writer that writes scalar metrics to disc. It is
      also accessible to callbacks for custom writing in other formats.
    callbacks: A sequence of self-contained programs executing non-essential
      logic (e.g. checkpoint saving, logging, timing, profiling etc.).
    compile_model: For faster training the model can be compiled with torch.compile()
